## dbt Tests

### Overview
- **dbt tests** are assertions that validate your data's quality and integrity.
- They can be defined as built-in schema tests (e.g., not_null, unique) or as custom SQL tests.
- Tests run after models are built to catch data issues early.

### How It Works
1. **Define Tests:**  
   Add tests to your model’s YAML file or write custom SQL tests.
2. **Run Tests:**  
   Execute `dbt test` to check that your data meets defined expectations.
3. **Review Results:**  
   Analyze test outcomes to identify and fix data quality issues.

### Benefits & Best Practices
- **Data Integrity:** Prevents bad data from compromising analyses.
- **Error Prevention:** Stops issues in transformation pipelines before they reach production.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Integrate tests into your CI/CD pipeline for ongoing quality assurance.
- **Encouragement:** Use tests to drive confidence in your data—test, learn, and improve continuously.

### Example Test Definition
```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: customers
    columns:
      - name: id
        tests:
          - not_null
          - unique
      - name: email
        tests:
          - not_null
          - unique
```

Remember: dbt models and tests are core to a robust, scalable data transformation pipeline. Use them to ensure your data remains accurate, reliable, and ready for modern analytics challenges.
